# Random-Quote-Microservice
Personal Quick Project

I recall when I was learning how to do AJAX calls for the random quote machine project I had a hard time understanding how to make it work. It wasn't helped by the few available quote api's and trying to read and understand AJAX documentation for the first time. If you are in this  or similar situation yourself you are in luck becouse here is a simple API for your first project.

If you read on I will give you instructions on how to interface with this project and get it in to an html element.
